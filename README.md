# Product Recommendation System

## Project Overview
In this project, we develop a product recommendation system that suggests products to users based on their preferences and behavior. We'll perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization to gain insights into the data and build a robust recommendation model.

## Tools & Technologies Used
### For Data Analysis:
- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Jupyter Notebook
- SQL (for data querying)
- Scikit-learn (for basic statistical analysis)

### For Data Visualization:
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Plotly (for interactive visualizations)
- Tableau (for dashboard creation)

## Data Collection & Preprocessing

### Dataset Source
We used the **[Amazon Product Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/karkavelrajaj/amazon-products-dataset)** from Kaggle, which contains:
- 2,000+ products across multiple categories
- Product titles, descriptions, and features
- Price information and ratings
- Customer reviews and review scores

### Data Collection Details
* **Dataset Characteristics**:
  - Format: CSV files
  - Size: 45MB (compressed)
  - Time Period: 2020-2022 products
  - Categories: Electronics, Home, Kitchen, Books

* **Sample Data Structure**:
  ```csv
  asin,title,description,price,brand,category,rating,review_count
  B08N5KWB9H,Amazon Echo Dot,Smart speaker with Alexa...,49.99,Amazon,Electronics,4.7,124568

* *Cleaning and handling missing values*: We'll handle missing values and clean the data to ensure it's consistent and reliable.
* *Feature selection and engineering*: We'll select relevant features and engineer new ones to improve the model's performance.
* *Ensuring data integrity and consistency*: We'll ensure the data is accurate and consistent to build a reliable model.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* *Summary statistics and insights*: We'll calculate summary statistics to understand the data distribution and gain insights into user behavior.
* *Identifying patterns, trends, and anomalies*: We'll identify patterns, trends, and anomalies in the data to understand user preferences.
* *Handling outliers and data transformations*: We'll handle outliers and perform data transformations to ensure the data is suitable for modeling.
* *Initial visual representation of key findings*: We'll create initial visualizations to represent key findings and insights.

## Data Visualization & Interpretation
* *Selection of appropriate chart types for insights*: We'll select suitable chart types to visualize insights and trends in the data.
* *Aesthetics and clarity of visualizations*: We'll ensure the visualizations are aesthetically pleasing and clear.
* *Interactive elements (if applicable)*: We'll add interactive elements to the visualizations to enable users to explore the data.
* *Interpretation and storytelling with data*: We'll interpret the results and tell a story with the data to provide actionable insights.

## Description
Our product recommendation system uses a combination of natural language processing (NLP) and collaborative filtering to suggest products to users. The system analyzes product descriptions, user reviews, and ratings to provide personalized recommendations.

## Key Findings
* *Top-rated products*: We identified the top-rated products in each category.
* *User preferences*: We found that users prefer products with high ratings and good descriptions.
* *Product trends*: We identified trends in product sales and user behavior.

## Insights
* *Product categories*: We found that certain product categories are more popular than others.
* *User behavior*: We identified patterns in user behavior, such as users tending to purchase products with high ratings.

## Conclusion
Our product recommendation system provides personalized recommendations to users based on their preferences and behavior. The system uses a combination of NLP and collaborative filtering to analyze product data and provide actionable insights. The visualizations and insights gained from this project can be used to improve the recommendation system and increase user engagement.

## Future Work
* *Improving the model*: We'll continue to improve the model by incorporating more features and using advanced techniques.
* *Expanding the dataset*: We'll expand the dataset to include more products and users.
* *Deploying the model*: We'll deploy the model in a production environment to provide real-time recommendations.
